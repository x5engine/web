        Welcome to Gitcoin! Our mission is to
        <b>grow open source</b>. Open source software is a force for good in the world, and we believe it’s the key to saving the internet. While a generation of software careers has been powered by open source software, it’s still hard to make a living working on open source. We plan to bring our mission to the Web 3.0 ecosystem.

      <a href="https://gitcoin.co/explorer">The issue Explorer</a> is our first tool towards this end. Use it to find paid issues to work on in open source. Help build projects, ship code, and get paid in crypto tokens. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/explorer">Give it a try</a> and let us know what you think!
