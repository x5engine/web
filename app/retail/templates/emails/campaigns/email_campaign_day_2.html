      By this point, you might have poked around the Gitcoin <a href="https://gitcoin.co/explorer?utm_source=email&utm_medium=drip&utm_term=day2">Issue Explorer</a> to see the open source projects you could make money by contributing! If interested in doing work, here’s how.

      Check if a bounty requires approval from the funder by checking the Permissions section within the bounty. 
      {% endblocktrans %}
      <BR><BR>
      {% blocktrans %}
      If it states "Permissionless" you can click "Start Work" to provide a short action plan and get started on working.
      {% endblocktrans %}
      <BR><BR>
      {% blocktrans %}
      However if it states anything else, you can click the button "Express Interest" to provide a brief message to the bounty owner that you want to work on this issue.

      From here, you’ll receive an email and a notification when the issue is ready for you to work.

      You’ll be able to submit a PR directly onto the repo maintainer’s project from there. It’s that simple!

      CTA: Check out the <a href="http://gitcoin.co/explorer?utm_source=email&utm_medium=drip&utm_term=day2">Issue Explorer</a> if you haven’t already!
