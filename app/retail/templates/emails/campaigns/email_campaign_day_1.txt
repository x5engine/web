Day 1: Growing Open Source


Welcome to Gitcoin! Our mission is to grow open source. Open source software is a force for good in the world, and we believe it’s the key to saving the internet. While a generation of software careers has been powered by open source software, it’s still hard to make a living working on open source. We plan to bring our mission to the Web 3.0 ecosystem.

The Issue Explorer is our first tool towards this end. Use it to find paid issues to work on in open source. Help build projects, ship code, and get paid in crypto tokens. Give it a try and let us know what you think!

As time passes, we’ll send you more ways to get involved in Gitcoin. For now, we have a few areas you can nerd out with us, depending on where you’re most comfortable.

Join the Slack channel and say hi on #community-intros! 

Follow us on Twitter for updates on open source software. 

Add the Gitcoin Livestream to your cal (iCal, Google) for Friday at 2PM EST. We’ll have two weekly product demos from the blockchain & open source ecosystems (like Decentraland or meta-transactions with Austin Griffith). 

Oh, and here’s a kudos for getting to the bottom of this e-mail. :) welcome to the Gitcoin Family! 

See you on the interwebs,
