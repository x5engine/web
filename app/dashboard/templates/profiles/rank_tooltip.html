    <p>{{name}} Rank is Gitcoin's modified version of PageRank, which measures the<br>
      influence of different {{name}}s on the network.
    </p>
    <p>There are 3 types of ranks on the Gitcoin network:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>OrganizationRank</strong> - The measure of an Organization's influence on the network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>FunderRank</strong> - The measure of an Funder's influence on the network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ContributorRank</strong> - The measure of an Contributor's influence on the network.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fun facts about these algorithms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Range from 1-10</strong> - Each *Rank is scored on a range between 1 (lowest) and 10 (highest).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Compounding</strong> - If you are funded by a connector in the network, then that Rank is <br>
        worth than if you are funded by a solitary user.
      </li>
    </ul>
