Welcome to Gitcoin! :gitcoin:

Gitcoin's mission is to *Grow Open Source*.

A few quick facts:
- We are mission driven.  Check out our mission: https://gitcoin.co/mission
- We aren't an ICO.  There is no Gitcoin token.
- We are a community of blockchain developers.

Here's how to get started in the community
- Say hey :wave: in #community-intros
- Join the community livestream every Friday at 5pm EST: https://gitcoin.co/livestream

We believe that a great way to build new skills is to learn by doing, and Gitcoin's core product (Bounties) supports that.

Here's how to get started with bounties:
- Developer? Start by completing the contributor onboarding at https://gitcoin.co/onboard/contributor and check out the open bounties at https://gitcoin.co/explorer
- Repo Owner? Accelerate your dev progress by posting a bounty of your own at https://gitcoin.co/new
- Send a tip to any github username with https://gitcoin.co/tip

We have more details in our onboarding guide at https://gitcoin.co/docs/onboard . We also have a FAQ and tutorials available at https://gitcoin.co/help

If you have any feedback for the team, or just want to say hi, this is them:
- <@U55F2LT5L>, <@U88M8173P>, <@U8J2TK1L6>, <@U87BL3KS6>, <@U7Z23ATPB>, <@U9UKDGS01>, <@U88BVQAJD>, <@U9PL1BSAC>, <@U7J5ZPCPQ>, <@U85EFS1MM>

See you around! :spock-hand:
